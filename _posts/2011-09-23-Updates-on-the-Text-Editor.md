# {{page.title}}

Our Kickstarter project is now fully underway.  We are currently determining the best method of loading fonts onto the GPU and figuring out a shader to display text with.  At the moment arbitrary fonts, including any webfonts, can be used.  Currently we are working on syntax highlighting, trying to determine whether to use grammars or regular expressions to implement syntax highlighting.

We've had several visitors in both the irc chatroom and at our forum.  In case you're interested in visiting us you can join us at:

*Next Week:* We will be working more on the shader, in our attempt to offload as much as possible onto the GPU.

title: Betwixt Icon Final Font  
---

It's been another busy week, however much better than last week.  I've been able to get some work done on the icon.  Thanks to our commenter on the blog, the final font type has been selected for the icon...welcome [**Gentium Basic**](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gentium+Basic).  I'll be finishing up any further adjustments this weekend.  

As I haven't received any further comments about coloring or texture, I'll be going with what Robey and I think is best.  On Monday I'll be posting an entry with an image of the final icon, and any duotone options for printing that are created.  Thank you everyone for your opinions, suggestions, and patience.

After this I'll be creating all of the various **loot** items that backers are due to receive.  Once again, keep an eye out on the blog as I'll post when I get ready to send things out.  I'm expecting at the earliest end of August but most likely sometime in September.  

But before then we'll be sending out emails collecting everyone's information (addresses, T-shirt sizes and so on).  This email will be sent through Kickstarter.  We won't be able to ship you anything if you don't give us your address, so make sure to respond.

Hope everyone has a great weekend, we'll see you on Monday!

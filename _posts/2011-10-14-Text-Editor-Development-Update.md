First of all, let's start off with a [screenshot of what the rendering test looks like in Chrome](/images/2011/10/14/shadertest3.png).

This is a test in which a 4MB file (UTF-32, so equivalent to 1MB of ASCII) is loaded and rendered.  It's able to render at 60 frames per second using requestAnimFrame(), though given that no updates are occuring this doesn't tell you much other than it's not working horribly inefficiently.  It could easily render faster, but requestAnimFrame() intelligently throttles it.


## Font Rendering and Text Layout in WebGL

The bulk of my effort so far has been here.  I've built multiple experiments trying to find a good simple way to offload as much of the work of rendering the fonts to the GPU.  I've got a good one.  The text is converted to a texture with each pixel representing a letter.   An additional texture is necessary to encode the location of line breaks.  The benefit of doing it this way is that a pixel provides 32 bits of storage, so I can do UTF-32 as well as highlighting information in the same pixel.  This is as UTF-32 only actually uses 21 bits per character.  

I then load up a font texture (which is just a standard bitmap font) using 

All of this loading stuff into textures means that the rendering can all be done in the fragment shader.  The first thought, and what many bitmap font renderers seem to do is to store all of the information in the vertex arrays.  This means that 6 vertices are needed for every letter and I'd need to duplicate information a lot.  It would give me more flexibility as to positioning, but all of that positioning would have to be done in the JavaScript and uploaded to the graphics card for each change.  By using the fragment shader I use 6 vertices to outline the page then each pixel determines which letter it is, where in the letter it is and what color that location of the letter is.  

## Font Loading

Since WebGL inherently has support for nothing but numbers and arrays of numbers bitmapped fonts are the most direct way to get font rendering onto the graphics card.  I could have just prerendered a couple of fonts, but then we'd be rather limited.  So instead I wrote a small library to load a font and render it to a canvas with even spacing.  It can then be loaded onto the graphics card as a texture and used by the shaders to render fonts. It can current load fonts from either the local system or use any of the [web fonts available from Google](http://www.google.com/webfonts).  There are some sizing issues, and since there is quite literally no font metrics other than width built into JavaScript there is some work to be done here.  With some baseline fiddling (as in, a little more up... a little more down) this works for now. 


## Syntax Highlighting

I was originally split between doing more formal parsing of the text, which would allow
for things like auto-completion and context aware editing to be based on the actual state
of the code instead of heuristics.  The thing is, I was not able to find a good set of
formal grammars for very many languages.  Vim has a very large set of defined syntaxes
and writing an interpreter for these is inline with the other project goals.

## Vim Commands

Vim has a very large set of runtime files using it's internal command system.  Of primary interest are the syntax and indent files.  Then there are also plenty of macros and all of the extras written by others on the vim site itself.  In order to use these though the editor needs to understand a subset of the commands used.  For the syntax files this is primarily the :syntax and :highlight commands.  However, the editor is supposed to be extensible using JavaScript, so here's the happy medium:  line by line conversion from vim commands to JavaScript.

This has the side-effect of meaning that the command mode for the editor will accept either vim commands (assuming that a conversion exists) as well as javascript macros.  This will be done through a simple construct + algorithm: 

``` javascript

syntax = {
  keyword: function( groupName, keywords ){
    //function to run for command
  },
  _keyword_arguments: {
    //regex mappings to arguments
  }
};
```

1. Start at beginning.
2. Is current word a valid variable name?  Does it exist in our command dictionary?  If so go to next word and repeat this step.
3. Execute command using provided argument translation.

This should allow the command to run using either the traditional vim syntax `:syntax keyword keywordDefinition thisisthekeyword` as well as direct javascript `syntax.keyword("keywordDefinition","thisisthekeyword")`.  Some of the regular expressions for this will end up being complex, but at least their scope is limited and can be done on a case by case basis.

## Input

In reviewing existing JavaScript editors I've discovered that all of them use a hack of somekind with regards to key input.  The problem is that the way this information is provided to JavaScript is inconsistent and incomplete.  The most direct hack is to use a textarea and monitor it for changes.  For the moment this is the method that I've been using for my development.


## File Loading and Saving

Local file loading can be done through Chrome by acquiring access to file:/// urls (this is just a permission).  Local file saving is a little more difficult.  If we're willing to restrict ourselves to a sandbox we can do everything, but this will require that files we wish to edit must be moved to a particular location.  I've yet to start work on particular loading/saving plugins for online services.

## Summary

I'm not entirely happy with the current rate of progress.  I was hoping that the state of libraries would be a little further along for this.  Unfortunately, while some WebGL libraries do support some text, they expect this text to be rendered in the JavaScript and not to change regularly.  Doing it this way would defeat the purpose of the project.  Additionally, with syntax highlighting and text parsing, each of the existing editors has not produced a library solely for parsing.  I could take pieces, I've looked at the code for each, but each seems to define it's own syntax for defining... syntax.  Using a more established standard instead of reinventing all of this syntax files makes sense.

So, sadly, things are taking more of a "not-developed-here" tack than I'd hoped.  Of course, there are existing approached to use for inspiration.

* WebGL text-rendering library
* Font to Bitmap library
* Vim Command Interpreter
* Vim Compatible Syntax Highlighting

There are some things that I will not have to develop libraries for:

* Regular Expressions
* Matrix Operations
* Syntax Files themselves

Last week's voting has given us a basic logo. The clear winner was:

![Icon Option 1](/images/2012/06/05/Betwixt1.png)

Rachael will be working on polishing this up into a finalized logo for use on
the T-shirts, bags, postcards and other such assorted items.  If she produces
some more variations we'll vote again on those. Once we've got final versions of
everything we'll finally be ready to print and ship the various items to everyone.

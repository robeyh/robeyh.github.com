title: Worked on the Blog Redesign this Afternoon
---

Finally got to something that has been on the todo list for a long time: redesigning the blog and moving away from posterous.  I like posterous' system in general.  I actually had a much more primitive blog system I wrote long ago that used mbox to store entries and used signed email to enable publishing and editing in my email client.  What I don't like is how much they prevent you from doing and what they end up doing to your code.  Seems like there are 20 layers of overlays placed on after your template.  And not being able to use javascript in your template is understandable from the perspective of attempting to prevent the misuse of a service, but it's too limiting for me.

So, here it is at github.  I'm starting out with a dropdown on hover box for the twitter feed... not sure how much I like it yet.  And I need to migrate the content and put links to projects and other blogs.  Should all happen over the next couple of days.
